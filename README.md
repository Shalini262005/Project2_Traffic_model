# Project2_Traffic_model
Predicting Car Colors and Counting Vehicles at Traffic Signals
Objective: Develop a model to predict car colors and count cars at traffic signals. Additional conditions included swapping color predictions for red and blue cars, predicting the number of males and females at the signal if people were present, and counting other vehicles.

Activities:

Data collection and preprocessing: Compiled a dataset of traffic images with various vehicle types and colors.
Model development: Created a model to identify car colors and count vehicles.
Condition handling: Added logic to swap color predictions and count people and other vehicles.
Testing and validation: Ensured the model's performance met the project requirements.
